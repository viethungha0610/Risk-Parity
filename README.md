Version 1.0

This project provides an investment portfolio allocation tool to provide Risk Parity. 
Pioneered by Bridgewater Associates, Risk Parity aims to diversify investments based on the individual investment's risk profiles and the investments' correlation.
It does so by allocating the portfolio in a way that each investment contributes the equal amount of risk to the portfolio.
